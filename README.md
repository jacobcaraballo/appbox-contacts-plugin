#What is AppBox?
AppBox is a lockscreen tweak for jailbroken devices. You can purchase AppBox on Cydia in the BigBoss Repo for 0.99.

#What are App View Plugins?

AppBox has a powerful feature called "App Views". App views are views that can be activated when an icon is tapped and held. Stock app views are Contacts, Playlists, Social, & Notes. This repository contains all the code I used for the contacts app view plugin.

App View plugins are simply a bundle that, when installed onto the device, is loaded into AppBox and can be selected by the user for implementation into AppBox.

What makes these plugins powerful are their ability to interact with the tweak itself. For examples on how to create and implement AppBox Plugins, please read the comments in the code provided.
